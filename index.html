        Climate change is something we have to include in every single analysis,
        every investment. Most people think—or hope—that global warming is
        something their children or grandchildren will have to reckon with.
        Climate change however is happening suddenly and soon. The world is
        skidding toward a future that’s overheated and underwater—and where
        carbon will be treated as a costly waste product that needs to be
        captured and stored

          the design of cities. Our investments embrace sustainability and
          positive impact as a competitive advantage. We don’t compromise profit
          for purpose. We believe every investment is an opportunity to champion
          long term sustainability.
